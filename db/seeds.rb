# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# User.create(username:"aman",password:"password")
# User.create(username:"sahil",password:"password")
# User.create(username:"ajay",password:"password")
# User.create(username:"demo",password:"password")


Message.create(body: "hi from aman ",user:"aman")
